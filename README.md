# Mafia-RE

Project that aims to completely decompile Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven.

## Progress

The project is in a very early stage, the only fully decompiled parts are `rw_data.dll` and `setup.exe`

There are 2 big tasks ahead, the engine `LS3DF.dll` and the game itself `Game.exe`, both of these are quite big and it will take a long time to reverse them.

Right now the goal is to replace every function one by one using the replacer located in `injector/`, until we have the full game decompiled
